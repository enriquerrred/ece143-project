1. The project proposal is available in the file "Nikhil-ECE143-FinalProject-Proposal"

2. Dataset

We used three different dataset for this project, they are

(1) IBM HR Attrition Dataset, provided by kaggle.com, available @ https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset 

(2) BRC HR Attrition Dataset, provided by Ms. Jane Liu, available in the repository, named "BRCLeavingListDataSet"

(3) Employee Review Dataset, provided by kaggle.com, available @ https://www.kaggle.com/petersunga/google-amazon-facebook-employee-reviews 

The first two can be download from the repository, the third one is too big and can only be downloaded via kaggle.

3. Data processing

The ipython notebook file "IBM Attrition Update" is for processing and visualizing basic analysis of IBM dataset

The ipython notebook file "BRCLeaving-DataPlot-ChEdit" is for processing and visualizing basic analysis of BRC dataset

The "Data_loader.py" & "Prediction.ipynb" is for doing machine learning on IBM Dataset

The "Employee review.ipynb" is for doing machine learning and analysis on employee review dataset
